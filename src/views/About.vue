            Mental Health is a really important topic for me, No place for
            making fun of it. I personally know hos it is to feel like trash for
            weeks, month, years, as I even to this day I'm suffering of
            depressions and server Social Anxiety. if you need anything, Im
            allways availiable on Twitter and Discord.
